# About
I am a passionate game developer with over seven years of experience, specializing in Unity Game Engine. I have keen interest in shader art and procedural generation algorithms. Currently, I’m working as a Unity Developer Intern at Fabwelt Studios, where I focus on gameplay programming to bring engaging and innovative game mechanics to life.

In addition to game development, I’m passionate about various creative outlets. I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, reading, and sketching in my spare time, all of which fuel my creativity and inspire my work.

# Games
## 1. [Funky Blueprints](https://bharathk33.itch.io/funkyblueprints)

A physics based puzzle game, where you draw different contraptions to carry the heart to its destination. It was made in Godot in a week. It was my first time using Godot, but the engine's similarity to unity enabled my team to finish it in time.

The main highlights of the game are:
- Custom physics shapes, made up of capsule colliders of different sizes
- An enjoyable difficulty curve
- Whacky Gameplay, due to physics bugs
- Won Second Place in Game Forge (IIT Palakad)

The main highlights of the game are:
- Random Generation of obstacles whose frequency increases as time progresses
- Physics based car controls
- Controlled random generation of rules
