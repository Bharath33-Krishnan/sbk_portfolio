## 1. [Funky Blueprints](https://bharathk33.itch.io/funkyblueprints)

A physics based puzzle game, where you draw different contraptions to carry the heart to its destination. It was made in Godot in a week. It was my first time using Godot, but the engine's similarity to unity enabled my team to finish it in time.

The main highlights of the game are:
- Custom physics shapes, made up of capsule colliders of different sizes
- An enjoyable difficulty curve
- Whacky Gameplay, due to physics bugs
- Won Second Place in Game Forge (IIT Palakad)
