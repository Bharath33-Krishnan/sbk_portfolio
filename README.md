A physics based puzzle game, where you draw different contraptions to carry the heart to its destination. It was made in Godot in a week. It was my first time using Godot, but the engine's similarity to unity enabled my team to finish it in time.

The main highlights of the game are:
- Custom physics shapes, made up of capsule colliders of different sizes
- An enjoyable difficulty curve
- Whacky Gameplay, due to physics bugs
- Won Second Place in Game Forge (IIT Palakad)

A time attack game, made in Unity.My first step into procedural generation.The goal of the game is to survive the timer, but you should not stop your car, you also need to follow the randomly generated rules, else your car will blow up.

The main highlights of the game are:
- Random Generation of obstacles whose frequency increases as time progresses
- Physics based car controls
- Controlled random generation of rules
- Hand made UI in paint
- Submission to GMTK jam 2020 (placed overall 1563/5267)

- Automatic level creation, based on oede of gameobjects in hierarchy
- Extensible weapon system
- Hand made UI and art
